# School-Project
This is a school system designed to enable secondary schools to run and carryout all school activities some of which are:
Generating and printing out of students reports, tuition or school fees, paying workers  (teaching and non-teaching staff),
Keeping marks record,  library management, student and teachers registration and keeping other school information. 
This project is designed and programmed using java (java FX and CSS for user interface design) and SQL database. 
This proves me to be good in java with experience gained from this project.
